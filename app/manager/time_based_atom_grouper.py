class TimeBasedAtomGrouper(object):
    """
    This class implements the algorithm to best split & group atoms based on historic time values. This algorithm is
    somewhat complicated, so I'm going to give a summary here.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Let N be the number of concurrent executors allocated for this job.
    Let T be the aggregate serial time to execute all atoms on a single executor.
    Both N and T are known values at the beginning of this algorithm.

    In the ideal subjob atom-grouping, we would have exactly N subjobs, each allocated with T/N amount of work that
    would all end at the same time. However, in reality, there are a few factors that makes this solution unfeasible:

    - There is a significant amount of variability in the times of running these atoms, so numbers are never exact.
    - Certain builds will introduce new tests (for which we don't have historical time data for).
    - Not all of the machines are exactly the same, so we can't expect identical performance.

    We have two aims for this algorithm:

    - Minimize the amount of framework overhead (time spent sending and retrieving subjobs) and maximize the amount of
      time the workers actually spend running the build.
    - Don't overload any single executor with too much work--this will cause the whole build to wait on a single
      executor. We want to try to get all of the executors to end as close to the same time as possible in order to
      get rid of any inefficient use of worker machines.

    In order to accomplish this, the algorithm implemented by this class tries to split up the majority of the atoms
    into N buckets, and splits up the rest of the atoms into smaller buckets. Hopefully, the timeline graph of
    executed subjobs for each of the executors would end up looking like this:

    [========================================================================][===][==][==]
    [===============================================================================][==]
    [====================================================================][====][===][==][=]
    [========================================================================][===][==][=]
    [=====================================================================][====][==][==]
    [==================================================================================][=]
    [===================================================================][======][==][==]

    The algorithm has two stages of subjob creation: the 'big chunk' stage and the 'small chunk' stage. The 'big chunk'
    stage creates exactly N large subjob groupings that will consist of the majority of atoms (in terms of runtime).
    The 'small chunk' stage creates ~2N short subjob groupings that will be used to fill in the gaps in order to aim for
    having all of the executors end at similar times.

    Notes:
    - For new atoms that we don't have historic times for, we will assign it the highest atom time value in order to
      avoid underestimating the length of unknown atoms.
    - We will have to try tweaking the percentage of T that we want to be allocated for the initial large batch of
      big subjobs. Same goes for the number and size of the smaller buckets.
