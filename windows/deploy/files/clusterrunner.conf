## This file contains the default values for common configuration settings.  ClusterRunner expects a
## clusterrunner.conf file in the user's ~/.clusterrunner directory (or a location specified on the command line),
## and it will copy this file to ~/.clusterrunner/clusterrunner.conf if that doesn't exist.  Uncomment settings to
## change their defaults. Settings which are specified via the command line (e.g. clusterrunner master --port 43777)
## will override these values.
