# ClusterRunner

ClusterRunner makes it easy to execute test suites across your infrastructure in the fastest and most efficient way possible.

By using ClusterRunner in your testing pipeline, you will be able to easily:

- Make long-running, single-threaded test jobs run in parallel.
- Consistently utilize 100% of your testing infrastructure.
- Get test feedback faster.
- Completely isolate tests from each other, avoiding nasty global state.

The entire process of installing, initializing, and executing tests through ClusterRunner should take about 8 minutes!

Give it a shot by starting at our [documentation](https://www.clusterrunner.com) site.

## Visualize

ClusterRunner currently has no built-in UI, but its extensive API allows you to create detailed dashboards so you
can monitor your cluster and see what it's doing.

We've open-sourced a few of the dashboards we use internally at Box for monitoring our own clusters. Check out the
[ClusterRunner-Dashboard](https://github.com/box-labs/ClusterRunner-Dashboard) repo for the code and documentation.

## Contribute

We :heart: external contributors! You can run ClusterRunner entirely locally and it has a comprehensive functional test suite, so
it's easy to get started. Take a look at our open issues to get an idea of where you can help out.
