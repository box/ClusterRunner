# ClusterRunner

ClusterRunner makes it easy to execute test-suites across your infrastructure in the fastest and most efficient way possible.

By using ClusterRunner in your testing pipeline, you will be able to easily:

- Make linear (i.e.: single-threaded) test jobs run in parallel
- Consistently utilize 100% of your testing infrastructure
- Get test-feedback faster
- Completely isolate tests from each other, avoiding nasty global-state

The entire process of installing, initializing, and executing tests through ClusterRunner should take about 8 minutes!

Give it a shot by starting at our [documentation](http://www.clusterrunner.com) site.
