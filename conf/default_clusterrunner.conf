## This file contains the default values for common configuration settings.  ClusterRunner expects a
## clusterrunner.conf file in the user's ~/.clusterrunner directory (or a location specified on the command line),
## and it will copy this file to ~/.clusterrunner/clusterrunner.conf if that doesn't exist.  Uncomment settings to
## change their defaults. Settings which are specified via the command line (e.g. clusterrunner master --port 43777)
## will override these values.

[general]
## The root directory for files used during the build process.
# base_directory = ~/.clusterrunner

## Symlinks to each build's project files are created here, to keep paths consistent across machines.
# build_symlink_directory = /tmp/clusterrunner_build_symlinks

## The level to log at.  Other options are DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITIAL.
# log_level = 'WARNING'

## A list of slaves, used for starting slaves with the "clusterrunner deploy" command
# slaves = hostname01.example.com, hostname02.example.com, hostname03.example.com

## The hostname to refer to the local machine with
# hostname = localhost

## Should we automatically reject all git remote operations on hosts that are not in known_hosts?
# git_strict_host_key_checking = False

## CORS support - a regex to match against allowed API request origins, or None to disable CORS
# cors_allowed_origins_regex = None

## Should the slaves get the project from master or not
# get_project_from_master = True

## Secret string used for authenticating requests on master and slaves. By default, a secret is
## randomly generated on startup and saved. If the master and slave(s) are on different hosts, this
## value must be set to "None" to disable authentication, or to a common value for all hosts.
# secret = None

[master]
## The port the master service will run on
# port = 43000

[slave]
## The port the slave service will run on
# port = 43001

## The maximum number of parallel executions to run on this slave
# num_executors = 1

## The master's hostname this slave will connect to
# master_hostname = localhost

## The master's port this slave will connect to
# master_port = 43000
