# Source should be a URL pointing to a tarball of the your application's source.
# Note that the rpmbuild tool does not read the entire URL. It only reads the
# last path segment, which MUST match the pattern "{name}-{version}.tar(.gz)".
# Therefore, the value "http://mydomain.com/{name}-{version}.tar.gz" is
# equivalent to "{name}-{version}.tar.gz".
#
# The full URL is purely extra information for humans and is considered good
# practice to include.

Description = ClusterRunner makes it easy to execute test suites across your
    infrastructure in the fastest and most efficient way possible.

[Interpreter]

# Requires is a space-delimited list of package dependencies needed for running
# your Python app. Note that these are system dependencies, not Python library
# dependencies. Python dependencies should be listed in your requirements.txt
# like normal.
Requires = python34 git

# BuildRequires is similar to Requires, but contains dependencies for building
# your Python app.
BuildRequires = python34-devel

# PythonCommand is the command that should be used when invoking the Python
# interpreter for your app. For example, it can be used to distinguish between
# "python", "python2", or "python3".
PythonCommand = python3.4

[Entry Points]

# The Entry Points section is a mapping of commands to entry points in your
# Python app. For example, "mycmd = main.py" will cause /usr/bin/mycmd to
# invoke the main.py script in your app.
clusterrunner = main.py
